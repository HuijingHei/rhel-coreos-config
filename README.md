# RHEL CoreOS and CentOS Stream CoreOS config

This repository is the "config" repository used to build RHEL CoreOS and CentOS
Stream CoreOS using [coreos-assembler].

The main output is a bootable container image containing _only RHEL/CentOS
Stream content_ (i.e., no OpenShift components). This container image is then
used as the base image to build the [OpenShift node image].

## Variants

To support building both a RHEL-based and a CentOS Stream-based CoreOS, the
coreos-assembler concept of [variants] is used. The following variants are
supported:

- RHEL-based variants: `rhel-9.6`, `rhel-10.1`
- CentOS Stream-based variants: `c9s`, `c10s`

The default variant is `rhel-9.6`.

## Reporting issues

The issue tracker for this repository is only used to track the development
work related to RHEL CoreOS.

**Please report OKD or CentOS Stream CoreOS issues in the [OKD issue tracker].**
